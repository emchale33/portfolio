As a consulting team member, I contributed to the development and execution of a Build-A-Brand workshop in collaboration with Cal Athletics. The workshop aimed to empower athletes across Cal's 28 Varsity Athletic programs to strategically build their personal brands and capitalize on emerging NIL (Name Image Likeness) opportunities. 

### Executive Functioning Risk Taking
As part of the Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program within the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley, I collaborated with two fellow URAP students and a Haas faculty mentor on a research project focused on understanding the relationship between risk-taking behavior and executive functioning.
